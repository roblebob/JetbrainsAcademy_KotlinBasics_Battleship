<p>Imagine you have created a <code class="java">MailBox</code> class, and it can accept all types of parameters. Also you've created a class <code class="java">Letter</code>. Your friend added a type bound, and <code class="java">MailBox</code> now accepts only <code class="java">CherryPie</code>, which is not what you need! It would make more sense to restrict type bounds so that <code class="java">MailBox</code> can accept only <code class="java">Letter</code> and its descendants as parameters. Correct the provided code. </p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
